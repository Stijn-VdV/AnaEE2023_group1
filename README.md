This repository contains R-scripts written during the AnaEE 2023 microclimate Summer School in *le Jardin du Lautaret*.

During data processing, the nested structure of experimental design caused some issues in joining measurement and metadata. More specifically, some plots were assigned 2 habitat types rather than one. Such plots had sensors installed in one of the 'regular' habitat types, in addition to sensors installed in water. The joining issues were only noticed late in the process of data preparation and modelling, and have not yet been solved in the included scripts.
